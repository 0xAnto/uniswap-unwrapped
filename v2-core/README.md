### What does uniswap do?

- Basically there are two types of users liquidity providers and traders

- Liquidity providers provide liquidity to the pool and in return they get third token that represents the partial ownership of the pool called liquidity token.

- Traders can swap tokens means then can provide a token and receive another token. The exchange rate is determined by the relative number od tokens in the pool (according demand & supply). The pool takes a small percent as a reward for the liquidity pool.

- When liquidity providers want their assets back they can burn the liquidity token and receive back their assets, including the share of reward.

### Contracts

- Uniswap v2 is divided into 2 contracts, a core and a periphery.The division allow the core contract, which holds all assets and therefore it needed to be secure, to be simpler and easier audit. All the extra functionality required by traders can then be provided by periphery contracts.
